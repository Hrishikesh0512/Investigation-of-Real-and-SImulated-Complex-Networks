# Investigation of Real and Simulated Complex Networks 
# Description of the project
The Analysis of various Real and Simulated food webs graphs was done to find important ecological insights for analysis and comparision.The Python NetworkX Package was used to apply various Graph Metrics on the datasets. Appropirate metrices were applied for both directed and undirected graphs. and based on that two .csv output files were created which stored the parameters. 

The Project Consists of two files

Directed_Graphs.ipynb
Here, All the Directed Graphs were loaded and then after application of suitable graph metrices the result parameters were stored in a csv file which was then used for 
analysis and comparision between multiple directed graphs.
Unidirected_Graphs.ipynb
In Similarity with the directed graphs, All the UnDirected Graphs were loaded and then after application of suitable graph metrices the result parameters were stored in a csv file which was then used for analysis and comparision between multiple directed graphs.
